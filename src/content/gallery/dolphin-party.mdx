It started with some [kittens](https://o_ove.artstation.com/projects/29gzwJ) and a dolphin in a Christmas sweater. As anyone in the table top hobby familiar with AI images knows, they can be very handy for creating character images. At some point, I'd like to make these into proper NPCs, but until then you can enjoy the pictures.

And yes, I know that many of them have weird extra eyes... I guess that gives them advantage on perception or something.
