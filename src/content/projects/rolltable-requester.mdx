A simple Foundry Virtual Tabletop module to make it more accessible to use random tables while you are playing with your group. You can prompt players to roll on tables that you have in Foundry and it will make a proper roll and present the GM with the result. You have the option of disclosing the name and description of the table being rolled on, or keep it a mystery.
