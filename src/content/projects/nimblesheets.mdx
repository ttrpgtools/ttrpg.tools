If you are looking for a way to track your character in Evan Diaz's [Nimble 2 RPG][nim], then you are in the right spot.

[nim]: https://nimblerpg.com/pages/nimble-2

<Image src={screenshot} alt="Screenshot of the Nimble Sheet interface" />

Provides basic character sheet tracking, along with NPC sheets and a simple encounter manager. In addition to working as a standalone tool, it is also a functional Owlbear Rodeo extension.

<div class="border rounded-lg py-4 px-6 m-0 *:my-0">

To use with Owlbear Rodeo, you can install a custom extension via the Manage Extensions panel (there is a plus button in the top right corner). Just enter `https://nimblesheet.ttrpg.tools/manifest.json` and it should be available to add to your world. If you want to capture the dice rolls in a shared, visible location, you can install my helper extension: `https://obr-dicelog.ttrpg.tools/manifest.json`.

</div>

As of 13 July, 2025, should support the release verson 2.0.2. Do let me know on Discord if that is not the case.
