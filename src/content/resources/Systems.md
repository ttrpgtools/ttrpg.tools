There are so many TTRPG systems out there in all sorts of different genres. I've only had the pleasure of playing in a few of them, but I'm going to try and record as many as I can here with links to find more information. Some are free, some are not, and I will try and provide summary information if I know it.

Some systems may not have a particular genre, as in they may be genre agnostic and I'll try and mention that where possible. But generally speaking, if a system has a primary genre, that's where I'll put it.

## Fantasy

- [[Dungeons & Dragons]] ([Official](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)) - The OG game. Comes in many editions. This is a decent place to start as the ecosystem and support are probably the richest.
- [[Pathfinder]] ([Official](https://paizo.com/pathfinder)) - Spun off from D&D around edition 3. This game is even more mechanically heavy than modern D&D.
