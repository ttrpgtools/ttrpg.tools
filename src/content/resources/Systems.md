There are so many TTRPG systems out there in all sorts of different genres. I've only had the pleasure of playing in a few of them, but I'll try to record as many as I can here, along with links to find more information. Some are free, some are not, and I will try to provide summary information if I know it.

Some systems may not have a particular genre, as in they may be genre agnostic, and I'll mention that where possible. But generally speaking, if a system has a primary genre, that's where I'll put it.

Some systems may have [[Starter Kits]] available to get you up and running quickly or let you test the game before buying.
