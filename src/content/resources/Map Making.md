Using pre-made maps is excellent, but sometimes you have something particular in mind for what you want for a specific scene, or a town, or you want to create your entire world map. In this case, using a map-making tool can provide you with the ability to make a map, even if you aren't necessarily the best artist yourself.

There is a wide variety of map-making tools out there. Some create more aesthetically pleasing maps, others adhere to a more traditional style, and still others are designed to generate random maps, eliminating the need for manual creation.
