## Maps & Tokens

Getting battle maps and tokens is often one of the things that a game master needs to do. Having a reliable source of high-quality maps, in particular, can be quite a boon. All of these providers have Patreon accounts in addition to their websites, where you can support them with a monthly fee and get access to a large number of maps.

## Music & Ambiance

While not strictly necessary, adding music and ambient soundtracks to your game can add a level of immersion that players will often appreciate. While there are several specific providers of fantasy and sci-fi music for your role-playing games, you can also find videos and music on YouTube, as well as services like Spotify or Apple Music.

In addition to background music, some people like to use sound effects, which are shorter, more immediate sounds that can represent, for example, explosions, magic spells, or laser blasters.
