For many years in the past, TTRPGs were limited to in-person at-the-table play. But thanks to changes in technology, particularly advanced during COVID, the ability to meet and play online has taken great steps forward.

At a minimum, most virtual tabletops provide a shared viewing space, typically meant to emulate the table, where you can place tokens that can be controlled by the players. The Game Master may also be able to add maps or drawings or other elements to enhance that shared experience. Other functionality that might be included could be chat, audio/video, dice rolling, and character sheet management.

- [Foundry Virtual Tabletop (FVTT)](https://foundryvtt.com) - powerful, feature rich app that you run locally, or find alternative hosting online. Flat fee to purchase. Lots of customization available.
- [Owlbear Rodeo](https://owlbear.rodeo) - a middle ground between very feature rich and super lightweight, allows two active games for free.
- [GameScape](https://gamescape.app) - simple drawing and token tools, closely emulates a classic hand-drawn battle mat. Free.
- [Roll20](https://roll20.net) - one of the earliest mainstream VTTs, fairly full featured with an online marketplace of content. Kind of rough around the edges. Free options with paid subscription plans.
