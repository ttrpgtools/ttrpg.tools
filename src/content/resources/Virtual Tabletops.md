Tabletop role-playing games, as the name suggests, were originally played at a table in person. But thanks to changes in technology, particularly advanced during COVID, the ability to meet and play online has taken significant steps forward.

At a minimum, most virtual tabletops provide a shared viewing space, typically meant to emulate the table, where you can place tokens that the players can control. The Game Master may also be able to add maps, drawings, or other elements to enhance the shared experience. Virtual tabletop software may also include chat, audio/video, dice rolling, and character sheet management.
