Unlike board games which often contain all that your need to play in the box, TTRPGs usually require additional tools and resources to facilitate gameplay. These can be physical items like dice and miniatures, or increasingly, digital tools like virtual tabletops (VTTs) and digital dice rollers.

I'm going to focus on the digital tools, here, but I will link to a few sites at the bottom where you can order physical items if you prefer.

## Virtual Tabletops
