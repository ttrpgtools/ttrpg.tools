Unlike board games which often contain all that your need to play in the box, TTRPGs usually require additional tools and resources to facilitate gameplay. These can be physical items like dice and miniatures, or increasingly, digital tools like virtual tabletops (VTTs) and digital dice rollers.

I'm going to focus on the digital tools, here, but I will link to a few sites at the bottom where you can order physical items if you prefer. Typically it is the game master who ends up collecting most of the tools in this hobby. However, there certainly are some tools that players might be interested in as well.

Some of these categories are large enough to warrant their own page.

- [[Virtual Tabletops]] - Apps and websites that allow groups to play online using digital maps and tokens.
- [[Token Builders]] - Tools to help create a digital representation of your characters.

## Campaign Management / World Builders

These tools are designed to help game masters, in particular, manage their campaigns and their worlds. Essentially allowing them to catalogue the descriptions and links between entities, like NPCs and locations, their various magic items or whatever they have in their game. This could be either for their own organizational purposes or to share with their players.

Some tools help guide you through the creative process with prompts for various things you might have in a campaign or a fantasy world. Others are more of a blank slate, allowing you to write things up freely. Most allow you to upload your own maps and create documents about places and people and make links between them.
