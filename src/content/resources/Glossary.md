## 1. Core Concepts

These describe the structure, format, and common terms used when talking about playing TTRPGs in general.

- **System** – The set of rules used to play a game. Different systems have different ways to handle combat, movement, skills, and storytelling. Examples: _Dungeons & Dragons_, _Cairn_, _Shadowdark_.
- **Mechanics** – The specific rules that tell you how to do something in the game (for example, how to roll dice to see if you hit a target).
- **Session** – One meeting where the game is played. It could last a couple of hours or a whole day.
- **Campaign** – A series of connected game sessions that tell an ongoing story with the same characters.
- **One-shot** – A short adventure designed to be finished in one session (though sometimes it takes more).
- **Adventure Module** – A prepared story or setting, often published, that a group can play through.
- **Encounter** – A single event or challenge in the game, often combat, a puzzle, or a social situation.
- **Story Hook** – An event or clue meant to draw the characters into an adventure.
- **Big Bad** – Short for “Big Bad Evil Guy/Girl” (BBEG); the main villain or biggest threat in a story.
- **McGuffin** – An important item or goal that motivates the characters to act, such as a magical artifact or lost treasure.
- **Table Talk** – Conversation between players that’s not in character, often to discuss rules or make plans.
