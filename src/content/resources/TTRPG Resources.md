## What Is a TTRPG?

A tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) is a collaborative storytelling experience where players take on the roles of characters in a shared world. One person acts as the game master (GM), describing the setting and adjudicating the rules. The rest of the players interact with the world through their characters using dice, character sheets, and imagination.

While Dungeons & Dragons is the most well-known system, it's just the tip of the iceberg ‚Äî many other systems exist, each with their own flavor, mechanics, and accessibility.

## Terms

Like most hobbies, TTRPGs have a number of terms and jargon that can be intimidating at first. I've listed a few here and you can visit the [[Glossary]] to read the full list.

- **System** ‚Äì The set of rules used to play a game. Different systems have different ways to handle combat, movement, skills, and storytelling. Examples: _Dungeons & Dragons_, _Cairn_, _Shadowdark_.
- **Mechanics** ‚Äì The specific rules that tell you how to do something in the game (for example, how to roll dice to see if you hit a target).
- **Session** ‚Äì One meeting where the game is played. It could last a couple of hours or a whole day.
- **Campaign** ‚Äì A series of connected game sessions that tell an ongoing story with the same characters.
- **One-shot** ‚Äì A short adventure designed to be finished in one session (though sometimes it takes more).
- **Adventure Module** ‚Äì A prepared story or setting, often published, that a group can play through.
