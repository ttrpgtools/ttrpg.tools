Hello adventurer

I am hoping to run an Index Card RPG one shot at some point in the first couple weeks of August 2023.

I've created this "<a href="https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/dyXD2WPb" target="_blank">Doodle</a>" to allow you to vote on a time.

We will be using my Foundry server.

If you haven't played before, here is a video that walks through creating a character. You don't need to create a sheet in advance. We can do that on the day in Foundry.

The one-shot I have in mind will use the Alfheim fantasy world. We can go over the details, but as a summary to think about, the "stock" life forms are:

- Human (+1 INT, +1 CHA)
- Dwarf (+1 STR, +1 CON)
- Elf (+1 DEX, +1 CHA)
- Torton (+1 CON, +1 Magic effect)
- Gerblin (+1 DEX, +1 Gun effect)

And the types available are:

- Warrior
- Hunter
- Shadow
- Bard
- Mage
- Priest

That said, if you prefer, you can use a pre-gen character.
