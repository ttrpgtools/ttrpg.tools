Hello adventurer

I am hoping to run a one-shot using the Index Card RPG system at some point in the first couple weeks of August 2023.

I've created this "Doodle" *(no longer valid)* to allow you to vote on one of the time slots I have available. If there is enough interest then I can run it twice.

We will be using Foundry VTT for play and Whereby for A/V. All you need is a browser. Details will be sent out prior to the game.

If you haven't played ICRPG before, that's fine, I'm not expecting prior experience. It is similar to D&D, but a bit lighter weight with some alterations. Here is a video that walks through creating a character. You don't need to create a sheet in advance. We can do that on the day in Foundry.

The one-shot I have in mind will use the Alfheim fantasy world. We can go over the details, but as a summary to think about, the "stock" life forms are:

- Human (+1 INT, +1 CHA)
- Dwarf (+1 STR, +1 CON)
- Elf (+1 DEX, +1 CHA)
- Torton (+1 CON, +1 Magic effect)
- Gerblin (+1 DEX, +1 Gun effect)

And the types available are:

- Warrior
- Hunter
- Shadow
- Bard
- Mage
- Priest

That said, if you prefer, you can use a pre-gen character.
