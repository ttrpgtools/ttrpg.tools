So you scanned the back of a card. Welcome.

If you are coming from one of the intro sessions I hosted, you may find my [TTRPG Resources](/resources/welcome) to be a great place to start.

If you were looking to get in touch with me, well, my [email address](mailto:colin@ttrpg.tools) is on the card :).

Or you can find TTRPG Tools in the following places:

<div class="flex gap-4 items-center not-prose">
